Basically, this program creates a new repo called **my-git-drive** in your account and uses it for performing file related
git operations. **This program has nothing to do with other repositories in your account or collecting user info**. 
You can even go through the source code, it's pure.

This program is solely written to be able to use GitHub as an instant dropbox.

- [icons8.com](https://icons8.com) - All the colored icons and even the app icon belongs to icons8.com. It's a fascinating
icon store.
